# pyIA
PyIA is a Python library for rigorous numerical analysis, implementing verified interval arithmetic and automatic differentiation. It features IEEE 754 directed rounding, sparse/dense interval matrices, and certified solvers for linear and nonlinear systems (Newton-Krawczyk). Proven to solve ill-conditioned benchmarks with guaranteed error bounds.
